Primarily interested in designing, building and operating IAM programs. </p> <p class="mb-8 text-sm"> Currently at <a href="https://riot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="border-b">Riot Games</a> helping teams to ship their products quickly and securely. </p> </section> <section class="gap-y-4 grid grid-cols-1 mb-10" id="Main"> <a class="flex items-stretch relative"> <h2 class="text-base text-indigo-50">Accomplishments</h2> </a> <div class="space-y-2" id="tldr"> <ul class="font-light list-disc max-w-2xl ml-5 space-y-4 text-sm"> <li> <h3 class="text-base text-indigo-50">Centralized Service AuthN/Z (A work in progress)</h3> <p class="leading-relaxed mt-2 pl-2">Wrote extensive IAM security policy documents outlining all compensating AuthN/Z controls the business would soon be requiring for all live services in the org. Defined a reference architecture to achieve compliance with the aforementioned policies. Presented the problem space, policies and project across the org. Received buy-in from infosec leadership, the central engineering architecture working group, and the relevant stakeholders. Currently building centralized AuthN/AuthZ, decoupled from service runtime for all internal APIs, and infrastructure control planes. The desired outcomes are that the business can more clearly speak to the services and resources available in our ecosystem, have a clearer risk profile across all services, and be able to govern fine grain access controls unilaterally.</p> </li> <li> <h3 class="text-base text-indigo-50">IDP Evaluation/Migration</h3> <p class="leading-relaxed mt-2 pl-2">Wrote an evaluation criteria and strategy for the business’s Identity Provider product requirements. Subsequently led the product evaluation of five vendors and presented quantitative findings to information security leadership. Ultimately, tech led the org-wide identity provider migration. Built terraform pipelines to allow the team to move faster. Resulted in 700+ applications/services migrating within a year, saving the business ~$500k.</p> </li> <li> <h3 class="text-base text-indigo-50">Business Continuity during Covid-19</h3> <p class="leading-relaxed mt-2 pl-2">Led the design and deployment of highly available BeyondCorp style gateways for corporate services as part of the overall business continuity efforts brought on by the novel coronavirus epidemic. This service shipped within less than two weeks, and led to 6000+ users being able to access internal corporate assets without adding additional load to the VPN concentrators.</p> </li> <li> <h3 class="text-base text-indigo-50">APIs for corporate-linked game entitlements</h3> <p class="leading-relaxed mt-2 pl-2">Designed, wrote and tested in GoLang, a microservice responsible for serving LDAP data in a more developer friendly (read: RESTful) fashion than its native protocol. Restful-LDAP was shipped in the hot path of several tools in the business and in the authentication runtime of the public game client. This service allowed for the business to grant employee specific entitlements to employees whilst still allowing us to use the external player facing identity services. Enabled R & D teams to ship faster to employees, which in turn allowed us to shorten the feedback loop between teams.</p> </li> <li> <h3 class="text-base text-indigo-50">MDM Program</h3> <p class="leading-relaxed mt-2 pl-2"> Built a corporate device management program from the ground up. This program was responsible for managing ~3000 devices, tailored to the HIPAA requirements of the particular line of business, as well as easing the onboarding of new devices and employees.</p> </li> <li> <h3 class="text-base text-indigo-50">Books By Phone</h3> <p class="leading-relaxed mt-2 pl-2">Shipped my first piece of customer facing software at the age of 14. Implemented a speech-recognition based interactive voice-response (IVR) book reader using Microsoft Speech Server and SIP connection as the client. The service reached a peak of ~2000 unique users per month querying the book and allowed blind users to query and listen to books easer than alternative methods of the time.</p> </li> <li> <h3 class="text-base text-indigo-50"> A study on natural human interfaces</h3> <p class="leading-relaxed mt-2 pl-2"> Between 2009-2011, conducted research on natural human interface paradigms. Subsequently designing and building two distinct physical interfaces. (A touchscreen wall, and a touchscreen table) Both were built as case studies surrounding the viability of multi-touch user interfaces in a variety of contexts. This was before multi-touch had become so ubiquitous and a key idea in the mobile operating system lexicon of user interfaces design as they are today. This work was awarded recognition by the USC California State Science Fair, and later on by the Orange County Engineering Council.</p> </li> </ul> </div> </section> <section class="mb-10" id="Pie"> <div class="gap-y-3 grid grid-cols-1 max-w-sm"> <h2 class="text-base text-indigo-50">Hobbies, interests, etc</h2> <p class="font-light leading-6 text-xs">Collecting <a href="https://www.massmadesoul.com/olivetti-valentine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="border-b border-red-500 text-red-500">typewriters</a> and various mechanical relics. <br> <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/metmac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="border-b border-blue-500 text-blue-500">Vinyl enthusiast</a> (it's not better than digital.
